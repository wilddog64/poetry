Soliloquy of Marc Antony in Julius Caesar
-----------------------------------------

O pardon me thou bleeding piece of earth
Thou art the ruin of the noblest man
Who ever liv√®d in the tide of times
Woe to the hands that shed this costly blood
Over thy wounds now do I prophesy
Which like dumb mouths do ope their ruby lips
And beg the voice and utterance of my tongue
A curse shall light upon the limbs of men
Domestic fury and fierce civil strift
Shall cumber all the parts of Italy

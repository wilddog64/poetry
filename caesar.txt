Soliloquy of Marc Antony in Julius Caesar
-----------------------------------------

O pardon me thou bleeding piece of earth
Thou art the ruin of the noblest man
Who ever liv√®d in the tide of times
Woe to the hands that shed this costly blood
Over thy wounds now do I prophesy
Which like dumb mouths do ope their ruby lips
And beg the voice and utterance of my tongue
A curse shall light upon the limbs of men
Domestic fury and fierce civil strife
Shall cumber all the parts of Italy
There's going to be so much blood and stuff
That moms won't even care when their kids get hurt

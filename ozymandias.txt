I met a traveler from an antique land 
Who said two vast and trunkless legs of stone 
Stand in the desert. Near them on the sand, 
Half sunk a shattered visage lies whose frown
And wrinkled lip and sneer of cold command
Tell that its sculptor well those passions read
Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things
The hand that mocked them and the heart that fed
And on the pedastal these words appear:
"My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings"
